# Hello, I'm Onur. Nice to meet you.

I'm a front-end and client-side web developer. Since my journey as a freelance designer nearly 10 years ago, I have worked remotely for many clients and agencies, tutored beginners, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products on many projects. I also worked as a full-time front-end developer in some agencies and companies.

I am keen to create static and interactive web pages using next generation JavaScript frameworks. I am very sensitive to UI & UX and a flat design fan.

I think successful interaction "Starts with user experience and ends with design".
